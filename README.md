GIMX
====

GIMX stands for _`Game Input MultipleXer`_ or _`Game Input MatriX`_.  
The purpose of this software is to control a video game console with a PC.  
It works with the PS3 and the Xbox 360.  
It operates:  
¤ over bluetooth: works with Linux (PS3) only. A compatible bluetooth dongle is required.  
¤ over usb: works with Linux and Windows (PS3, 360). A USB adapter is required.  
The application gets data from the PC peripherals (mice, keyboards and joysticks) and sends controls to the console over bluetooth or usb.  
Other controls such as gesture or voice are possible through the use of external software that emulate PC peripherals.
